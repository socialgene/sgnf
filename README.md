## Documentation

Can be found at https://socialgene.github.io

## Usage

> **Note**
> If you are new to using Nextflow and nf-core pipelines, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how
> to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline)
> using the example command below.

Note that this pipeline can initiate significant number of compute processes. If you are running on a cloud service you alone are responsible for any costs.

```bash
outdir="path_to_my/outdir"
outdir_download_cache="path_to_my/outdir_download_cache"

nextflow run  socialgene/sgnf \
  -profile ultraquickstart,docker \
  --outdir $outdir \
  --outdir_download_cache $outdir_download_cache
```

> Unlike nf-core hosted pipelines, you should be able to use configuration files to run the pipeline. A number of examples are available https://github.com/socialgene/sgnf/tree/main/conf/examples
